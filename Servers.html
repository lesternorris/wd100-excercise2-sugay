    <h1>W3 Server Software</h1>
    <p>A W3 server, like the ftp daemon , is a program which responds to an incoming tcp connection and provides a service to the caller.There are many varieties of W3 server software to serve different forms of data.
    </p>
    <h2>The basic daemon</h2>
    <p>The basic W3 daemon program serves files already in hypertext or plain text. This daemon then is used as a basis for many other types of server and gateway. Documentation includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>User guide .</li>
        <li>Internals -- a description of the code.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Much of the above may also apply in whole or part to other servers mentioned below. Whatever server you are running, you will probably be interested in:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tools for information providers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Making a new server</h2>
    <p>This daemon is often used as a basis for a more specific server for a given application. A server which allows a world of data to be seen as part of the W3 universe is known as a gateway. (Most servers could therefore be regarded as gateways, but the term implies some conversion or mapping between dissimilar worlds) . For short tutorials with examples, see:

    <ul>
        <li>Writing a server in C</li>
        <li>Writing a server as a script</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is a good idea to pick the basic daemon or one of the servers below as a starting point when making a new server.</p>
    <h2>Other servers and Gateways</h2>
    <p>These are servers which provide data extracted from other systems. they are built using code from the basic daemon, or scripts.</p>
    FIND gateway
    <dd>for CERN/VM XFIND which calls a REXX exec to get the information from the XFIND system running on the CERNVM mainframe.</dd>
    VMS Help gateway
    <dd>This allows any VMS help files to be made available to WWW clients. Runs on VAX/VMS.</dd>
    WAISGate
    <dd>A gateway to information available using the W.A.I.S. protocol.</dd>
    DCLServer
    <dd>A server for VMS systems which allows you to write a gateway to your own favorite information system using DCL.</dd>
    System33
    <dd>A (big) csh script server providing data including Xerox System33 documents, man pages in plain text, phone numbers, etc. etc...!
    </dd>
    Oracle
    <dd>A generic server to oracle. Could be used as a basis for gateways to specific Oracle databases.</dd>

    <dd>Gateway to the</dd>
    Geography server at U Michigan
